## Description
### A mini application for selecting and recording the users screen and saving the recording as a video file to the device.
    
## Installation
### Download as zip, extract, and download any depencies. It's expected to run from download. This application uses Electron, Node, and Chromium (Chrome)
    
## Usage
### It would be nice to be able to record my screen for longer periods of time and not be restricted to 5 minutes like some Chrome extensions give you.
### This application will work on Mac, Linux, and Windows.
